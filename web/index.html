			<p> On June 19th 2001 I was born in JFk hospital at 10:04. I am current member of the SBHS Boys Vollyeball Team and Wrestling Team and play competitive chess outside of school. I enjoy watching movies and my favorite is Inception starring Leonardo dicaprio and directed by Christopher Nolan. Music has become a signifigant aspect in my life and my favorite artist is Future. The first trait that comes to my mind when I think of myself is brave as I am not feared to try anything. My hobbies mainly include playing video games such as super smash brother and overwatch. My favorite food is apples , I love apples especially green apples. And lastly, I live with my mom, dad , and brother and have 3 cousins in India.  <p>
